## To-Do:
- Set up GitHub Authentication.
- Edit the `Config` Node based on your requirements (colors in HEX and include the `#`).
- Finally, the result will provide two URLs:
  - The first one is served via a CDN (statically) with cache enabled (Fast loading, slower update).
  - The second one is served directly from GitHub without cache or CDN (Quick Updates, Slower load).
```
